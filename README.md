# Over-Collateralized Stable Coin

This is a hardhat application for an over-collateralized stable coin depending on Ethereum.

## Overview

The purpose of this application is to allow users to create and trade over-collateralized stable coins on the Ethereum network. The stable coin is backed by a certain amount of collateral in ETH or other ERC-20 tokens, which ensures that the stable coin maintains a stable value relative to the underlying assets.
